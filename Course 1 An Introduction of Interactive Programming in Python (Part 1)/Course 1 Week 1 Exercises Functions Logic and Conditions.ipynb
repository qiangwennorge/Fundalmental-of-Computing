Players can purchase a lottery ticket with a specific number combination and, if the number on the ticket matches the numbers generated in a random drawing, the player wins a massive jackpot. Write a Python function powerball that takes no arguments and prints the message \"Today's numbers are %, %, %, %, and %. The Powerball number is %.\". The first five numbers should be random integers in the range [1,60), i.e., at least 1, but less than 60. In reality, these five numbers must all be distinct, but for this problem, we will allow duplicates. The Powerball number is a random integer in the range [1,36), i.e., at least 1 but less than 36. Use the random module and the function random.randrange to generate the appropriate random numbers.Note that this function should print the desired message, rather than returning it as a string.
